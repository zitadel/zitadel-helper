# zitadel-helper

The content in this repository is created with the intent to provide people which self-host ZITADEL with different scripts and fixes as workaround or additional support.
This includes situations in which ZITADEL could handle everything, but there is for example something that can be done to accelerate the operations.

Situations:
- [Backup and restore of cockroach databases](db/backup-and-restore.md)
- [Update ZITADEL from v2.13.1 to v2.14.0](fill-projections/fill-projections-v2.13.1-to-v2.14.0.md)
- [Update ZITADEL from v2.18.x to v2.19.0](fill-projections/fill-projections-v2.18.x-to-v2.19.0.md)
- [Update ZITADEL from v2.19.x to v2.20.x](fill-projections/fill-projections-v2.19.x-to-v2.20.x.md)
- [Update ZITADEL from v2.23.x to v2.24.x](fill-projections/fill-projections-v2.23.x-to-v2.24.x.md)
